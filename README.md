# React + Vite

I have developed a comprehensive and responsive image gallery that elegantly presents a collection of images. 
Users have the capability to log in to access the gallery page. 
Authenticated users can utilize the Drag-and-Drop feature,
allowing them to easily select and rearrange images within the gallery. 
To set up the project,
simply execute `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies, `npm run dev` to run the program, 
and `npm run build` to build the application.
