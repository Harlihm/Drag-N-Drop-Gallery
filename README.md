# React + Vite

I have developed a comprehensive and responsive image gallery that elegantly presents a collection of images. 
Users have the capability to log in to access the gallery page. 
<br>
Authenticated users can utilize the Drag-and-Drop feature,
allowing them to easily select and rearrange images within the gallery. 
<br>
To install the dependencies for the React project, you can use the command `npm install`. This will read the `package.json` file and install all the necessary packages listed in it.
<br>

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the program by using the command `npm run dev`. This will start the development server and run your React project.
<br>

and `npm run build` to build the application.
